* This branch solves a simpler version than the other branches (in the sense of no incoming effects) but approaches from income-space instead of type space
* Going from the income-space is arguably more general; when it comes to multidimensional heterogeneity, income space formulas still hold by replacing elasticity with (conditional) averages whereas parameters in the type space may blow up
